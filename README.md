## Overview

In today's interconnected world, our Grievance Registration Android Application leverages technology to address modern issues related to grievance registration. The project modules are designed to streamline and simplify the overall grievance registration process, saving users valuable time.

## Features

- **Image Severity Analysis**: Users can capture images through the application, and a machine learning model assesses the severity of the issue, categorizing it as high, medium, or low.

- **Geospatial Location Registration**: The application records the spatial location of the user during the image-capturing process. This information is crucial for identifying the overall location of the reported issue.

- **Effortless Grievance Submission**: Users can submit captured images along with relevant descriptions. The submissions are then sent to a government body responsible for addressing grievances.

- **Public Grievance Posts**: A grievance post is generated for each submission, visible to fellow citizens. Users can view and upvote these posts, creating a transparent system that encourages civic engagement.
